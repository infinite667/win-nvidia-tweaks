# Nvidia Peak Performance Profile

This repository contains an **NVIDIA Profile Inspector** profile designed to help your GPU stay in **high-performance mode** more consistently.

The goal is simple:  
➡️ reduce driver-level power saving and FPS limiting so the GPU can reach and maintain **higher clocks and power usage** when under load.

**File included:**  
- `Nvidia-Peak-Performance.nip`

---

## What this does

- Encourages **maximum performance behavior** from the NVIDIA driver
- Disables driver-side **FPS limits**
- Reduces unnecessary downclocking
- Helps the GPU sustain boost clocks longer (if thermals and power allow)

⚠️ This does **not** overclock your GPU. Hardware limits, cooling, and system power still apply.

## How to use

1. Download **NVIDIA Profile Inspector**
2. Run it (Administrator recommended)
3. Click **Import Profile(s)**
4. Select `Nvidia-Peak-Performance.nip`
5. Click **Apply changes**

That’s it.

## Recommended

- Plug in AC power (especially on laptops)
- Use **Best performance** Windows power mode
- Ensure adequate cooling

---

## Notes

- Higher performance may mean **higher power draw and heat**
- If anything behaves oddly, you can revert by resetting the profile or reinstalling drivers

Built for users who want **maximum performance with minimal hassle**.
